# The T3Con Website
A github page website for sharing basic details of the upcoming events of the T3Con.

# The Test Trove
We started with an objective to increase collaboration and share Quality Engineering/ Testing related knowledge among different QE groups.
The idea is to have discussions on testing related topics and be able to share our knowledge store with the outside QE community. We are building a community!
Currently, we are not just limited to Quality Engineering but open to other topics including Development, DevOps, Collaboration stories and Leadership.

# Workflow
Every quarter the website needs to be updated with the latest details of the event as well as the speakers. New branch is created each quarter to keep record of earlier events. Once the branch for current quarter has all the latets details updated, it has to be set as the default branch. Once this step is done the website starts reflecting the latest details.
